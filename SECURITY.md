# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to responsibly disclose security issues. We value the security of our users and take all vulnerability reports seriously.

## Supported Versions

We currently support the `main` branch of GEPA Next. If you are using an older version and discover a security issue, please indicate which commit or release you are using.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, **do not create a public issue or pull request**. Instead, please email the maintainers at <security@example.com> with the following:

- A description of the vulnerability and its impact.
- A proof of concept or steps to reproduce if possible.
- Any relevant logs, environment details, or configuration to help us reproduce the issue.

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide a plan for remediation. Once the vulnerability is resolved, we will work with you on disclosure.

## Response and Disclosure

We strive to fix confirmed vulnerabilities as quickly as possible. We will coordinate with you on public disclosure, giving you credit if desired. Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until an official fix has been released.

## Additional Resources

For general project guidelines, please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). By submitting a report, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
